Remember that you can use
    tempfile() 
to create a temporary file name in which to use
    download.file() 
and then delete the tempfile

Use of Gather() and Spread() to Wide-->Tidy and Tidy-->Wide formats, respectively

use of separate() and unite() for col names who are mult variables (eg 1960_fertility rate is year and fertility rate)

setequal() will return T/F if the two sets are equal, regardless of order
check setdiff() and union() and intersect()
the above are for vectors by base, but apply to df w/ dplyr loaded
